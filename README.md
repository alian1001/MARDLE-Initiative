M.A.R.D.L.E Initiative

This is a wordle clone in which follows the basic principle of the game wordle. The main theme would be the MARVEL multiverse in which words, are mainly based around MARVEL names, characters, and anything within. 
Based on the design, we have followed a futuristic design based on the MARVEL character Iron Man, together with color schemens and font pallets.

Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JS for the front end development, and for backend, Flask, RDBMS relations, python, model view controller, and much more.

We are a group of three, and on git, we branch off different branches based on the tasks we gave to each other, and when everything is proper, merge into main for final production.

For testing purposes, we will include our app.db file for testing purposes. Login info: User: test Password: test123
